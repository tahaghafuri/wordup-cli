It is based on docker-compose and uses a docker containerized LAMP-stack with all WordPress Plugins/Themes you need for your current project.

# Features

What you can do with wordup-cli:

* 💡**Rapidly test new ideas** - And develop your new WordPress theme/plugin projects in wordup. 
* ⏱**Speed up your development** - Install a new project with a blank WordPress installation in a matter of minutes
* 🛠️**Boilerplate** - Scaffold your theme/plugin with the official source code from WordPress (e.g. [underscore](https://github.com/automattic/_s)). You can also add code snippets like *Gutenberg* blocks to your source code.
* ⚙️**Automatic installation of dependencies** - Automatically download and activate public WordPress Plugins/Themes or even Github hosted projects (like e.g. [wp-graphql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql))
* 📚**Fixtures** - Add posts, pages, media files and many more automatically to your WordPress installation and develop immediately with your own page structure
* 🚀**Easy portability** - Export your theme/project or your whole WordPress installation. So that you can install it on a remote server.
* 📦**Backup your installation** - And (re)install a project from an exported wordup project.
* 🤩**Hassle-free remote WordPress connection** - Install your project, based on an existing WordPress hosted website (with the [wordup-connect](https://github.com/wordup-dev/wordup-connect) plugin). Use this feature for example to test major WordPress updates with ease locally.
* 👾**Share your stack** - wordup is the easiest way to share your WordPress project with the world or just your team members. Just type:  `git clone`, and then `wordup install`
* ✉️**Catch emails** - Catch all emails from WordPress and view the outgoing emails in a web UI

# Examples

Checkout this [VIDEO](https://wordup.dev/#video) on our website to see how fast you can setup a new WordPress dev environment.

# Installation / Requirements 

Make sure you have node >= 8.3 (npm >= 5.2) and [docker-compose](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine. 

We recommend to install wordup-cli **globally**: 

```sh
$ npm install -g wordup-cli
```

After installing wordup-cli, you can create your first project with `wordup init`

---

If you **don't want** to install wordup-cli globally, you can also use wordup-cli as a devDependency via `npx`. Start directly with a new wordup project: 

```sh
$ npx wordup-cli init
```

`npx wordup-cli init` will add automatically the wordup-cli to your new project devDependencies.

Note: If you use wordup-cli as a devDependency make sure to always use `npx` before every `wordup` command.
