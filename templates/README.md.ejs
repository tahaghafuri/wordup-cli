Happy Coding üöÄ

## Project setup 

To setup your development server, run the following command in your project folder:

```sh
$ wordup install
```

or if it's already installed:

```sh
$ wordup start
```

In your project you will find a folder called .wordup for the project specific configuration.

<% if (type == 'installation') { %>
## *Installation* project

You have selected a wordup project of type *installation*. 

This means that your **src** folder represents the wp-content folder of the WordPress installation.

Wordup doesn't show the rest of the WordPress source-code because you should never change files outside of the wp-content folder.
<% }else{ %>
## Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è

DON'T delete this <%= type %> in the WP-Admin, you will lose your src files.

That's why we also recommend to use a VCS like Git.

## Setup a WordPress plugin

Essential files for your WordPress plugin:

Create a file called `<%= slug %>.php` in /src folder with a doctype like this:

```php
/**
 * Plugin Name:     <%= name %>
 * Plugin URI:      PLUGIN SITE HERE
 * Description:     PLUGIN DESCRIPTION HERE
 * Author:          YOUR NAME HERE
 * Author URI:      YOUR SITE HERE
 * Text Domain:     <%= slug %>
 * Domain Path:     /languages
 * Version:         0.1.0
 *
 * @package         <%= slug %>
 */
```

<% } %>

<% if (type == 'theme') { %>
## Setup WordPress theme

There are two essential files for a WordPress theme:

`style.css` file with a doctype like this:

```php
/*
Theme Name: <%= name %>
Theme URI: THEME SITE HERE
Author: YOUR NAME HERE
Author URI: YOUR SITE HERE
Description: THEME DESCRIPTION HERE
Version: 0.1.0
License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Tags: YOUR TAGS HERE
Text Domain: <%= slug %>
*/
```

`index.php` file with the basic template for your theme.

Add these 2 files in /src folder.
